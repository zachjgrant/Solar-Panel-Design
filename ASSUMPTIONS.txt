Assumptions:
1. Performance is steady state.
2. Construction is of sheet and parallel tube type.
3. The headers cover only a small portion of the collector area.
4. The headers provide uniform flow to tubes.
5. Energy absorbed by the covers does not affect collector thermal losses.
6. Heat flow through a cover is one dimensional.
7. Temperature drop through a cover is negligible.
8. The covers are opaque to infrared radiation.
9. There is one-dimensional heat flow through the back insulation.
10. The sky can be considered as a blackbody for long-wave radiation at an
equivalent sky temperature.
11. Temperature gradients around the tubes can be neglected.
12. The temperature gradients in the direction of flow and between the tubes
can be treated independently.
13. Thermal properties are independent of temperature.
14. Loss through the front and back are to the same ambient temperature.
15. Dust and dirt on the collector are negligible.
16. Shading of the collector and absorber plate is negligible.

Variable Assumptions:
1. Heat transfer coefficient inside the tubes is constant at 300 W/m^2K
2. Convection heat transfer coefficient of the wind is constant at 10 W/m^2K (gentle breeze)
